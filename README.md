# ERP-Shipping-System-Domain-Analysis

The project is based on creating a domain analysis model involving use cases and class diagrams. The ShippingDomainDesign.mdj file has the diagrams which can be imported into software like StarUML.

The ShippingSystem folder has all the Java implementation for the class diagrams. I have created API for the system which can be further implemented. The code also has a working example of how the routing is done during the shipping process to minimize cost and speed up the delivery.
